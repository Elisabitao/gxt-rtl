# About #

Tested browsers are FF 4/5, Chrome. IE9 still has some problems. Rest browsers were not tested.
All the official skins are supported

Please note that modified GXT still supports LTR locales. Don't try to load RTL demos with the LTR locales (adding ?locale=`<some country>_<some language>` to the URL). It will not look correct such as rtl.html files refer to rtl css files. LTR version of demo can be accessed by these links:

I want to thank [bentins](http://www.sencha.com/forum/showthread.php?100887-RTL-Version-of-Ext-GWT-2.1.1) for the great job done on his project which adds RTL support to GXT 2.1.1. A lot of his code was used when i was adding RTL support to GXT 2.2.x.
